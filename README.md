# AI-in-astronomy
This repository provides links and information about Artificial Intelligence (AI), covering general concepts, how artifical neural networks (ANN) work, types of deep learning (DL), tools and packages, and examples of how AI has been used in the field of astronomy. It is non-exhaustive but can hopefully act as an initial guide.
